A forked implementation of
[react-native-easy-toast](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-easy-toast)

The reason of this fork is to satisfy our need of envoking an onPress when the user selects the toast message. In this fork we use the callback method (3rd arguement) of the `show` method.

Also added a more complete type definitions.
